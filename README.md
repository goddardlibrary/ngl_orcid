# ORCID API Tests

This module serves as both a template for module creation (due to simplistic functionality) and a test for accessing the ORCID API. You will need a Public API key and secret (https://orcid.org/organizations/integrators/API) from ORCID.

This module is takes CURL strings provided by ORCID (https://members.orcid.org/api/tutorial-searching-data-using-api) converted for consumption by PHP (https://incarnate.github.io/curl-to-php/) and displays the return results in a Kint dump (https://www.drupal.org/project/devel).

## Notes

This module is not intended for production use. This was created as a test and may be expanded as a test module.
